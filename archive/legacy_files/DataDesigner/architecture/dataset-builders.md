# Dataset Builders

The dataset builder subsystem orchestrates the end-to-end generation of a dataset from compiled column configs using an async DAG-based scheduler.

Source: `packages/data-designer-engine/src/data_designer/engine/dataset_builders/`

## Overview

`DatasetBuilder` is the central orchestrator. It receives a compiled `DataDesignerConfig`, instantiates column generators from the registry, and executes them through `AsyncTaskScheduler`.

The scheduler produces row-group parquet files managed by `RowGroupBufferManager`, with post-generation processing and profiling.

## Key Components

### DatasetBuilder

Entry point for generation. `build()` runs:
- `_prepare_async_run` -> `AsyncTaskScheduler.run()` -> telemetry and metadata

### Async Execution (`_build_async`)

Preparation (`_prepare_async_run`):
1. Builds `gen_map` — maps each column name to its generator instance (multi-column configs share a single instance)
2. Creates `ExecutionGraph` from column dependencies
3. Partitions rows into row groups by `buffer_size`
4. Constructs `CompletionTracker`, `RowGroupBufferManager`, `AsyncTaskScheduler`
5. Hooks `ProcessorRunner` for pre-batch and post-batch stages

`AsyncTaskScheduler` runs on a dedicated async loop with frontier-driven dispatch, task-admission leases, salvage rounds for failed tasks, and order-dependent locks for columns that must execute sequentially. Ready frontier tasks enter `FairTaskQueue`, are selected through virtual-time ordering, and are committed only after `TaskAdmissionController` acquires the required scheduler resources. Salvage-exhausted tasks are dropped except for preserved retryable failures: provider rate limits and local request-admission queue timeouts stay deferred and retry after cooldown/backoff so scheduler-local pressure delays records rather than discarding them.

### Execution Graph

`ExecutionGraph` (in `dataset_builders/utils/execution_graph.py`) models column dependencies:
- Upstream/downstream sets derived from `required_columns`, side-effect columns, and `skip.when` references
- `GenerationStrategy` per column (CELL_BY_CELL or FULL_COLUMN)
- Kahn topological sort for execution order
- `split_upstream_by_strategy` — separates batch-level from cell-level dependencies
- Skip metadata per column — `get_skip_config`, `should_propagate_skip`, `get_required_columns`, and `get_side_effect_columns` — queried at runtime to evaluate skip decisions

### CompletionTracker

Tracks per-row-group, per-column completion state:
- **Cell-level**: completed cell indices for `CELL_BY_CELL` columns
- **Batch-level**: full-column completion flags for `FULL_COLUMN` columns
- **Frontier**: computes ready tasks when backed by `ExecutionGraph`
- Handles dropped rows and downstream task enqueuing

### Conditional Generation (Skip)

Columns can be conditionally skipped per-row via `SkipConfig` (defined in `data_designer.config.base`). Two mechanisms control skipping:

1. **Expression gate** — `skip=SkipConfig(when="{{ expr }}")` on a `SingleColumnConfig`. The Jinja2 expression is evaluated per-row; when truthy, the column is skipped for that row and the configured `value` (default `None`) is written instead of calling the generator.
2. **Skip propagation** — when an upstream column was skipped, downstream columns auto-skip unless they set `propagate_skip=False`. Propagation checks `required_columns` against the row's `__internal_skipped_columns` set.

Skip evaluation is handled by two utility modules:

- **`skip_evaluator.py`** — `evaluate_skip_when` renders the expression in a `NativeSandboxedEnvironment` (native Python types, `StrictUndefined`). `should_skip_by_propagation` checks set intersection between required columns and skipped columns.
- **`skip_tracker.py`** — manages the `__internal_skipped_columns` metadata key on record dicts. Each record carries a `__internal_skipped_columns` set listing which columns were skipped for that row. `apply_skip_to_record` adds the column name to that set, writes the skip value into the cell, and clears any side-effect columns. `strip_skip_metadata_from_records` removes the `__internal_skipped_columns` key before DataFrame construction so it never reaches parquet.

`_run_cell` and `_run_batch` in `AsyncTaskScheduler` call `_should_skip_record` / `_apply_skip_to_record`. Skipped cells report as skipped (not success) in progress tracking.

DAG edges are added for `skip.when` column references in both `topologically_sort_column_configs` (compile-time sort) and `ExecutionGraph.create` (runtime graph) so skip-gate columns are generated before the gated column.

### RowGroupBufferManager

Manages per-row-group DataFrames and persistence:
- `checkpoint_row_group` → writes parquet via `ArtifactStorage`
- Writes dataset metadata after the first durable row group and at completion
- Tracks dropped rows and actual record counts for resume

### Resume Checkpointing

`DatasetBuilder.build(..., resume=ResumeMode.*)` can continue an interrupted run from the last durable checkpoint:

- `ResumeMode.NEVER` always starts a fresh run, using a timestamped dataset directory when needed.
- `ResumeMode.ALWAYS` resumes the existing dataset directory and raises on incompatible state.
- `ResumeMode.IF_POSSIBLE` resumes when the persisted config fingerprint matches; otherwise it starts a fresh timestamped run.

Resume configuration lives in `metadata.json`. Each metadata write includes the config fingerprint (`config_hash`, `config_hash_algo`, and `config_hash_version`) so compatibility checks do not need to deserialize `builder_config.json` for the common path. `builder_config.json` remains the human-readable record of the run configuration and the fallback for older datasets.

Resume scans `parquet-files/batch_*.parquet` and reads parquet metadata to recover the completed row-group IDs and their actual persisted row counts. `metadata.json` remains the source of truth for the run *configuration* (`buffer_size`, `target_num_records`, `original_target_num_records`, config fingerprint), but the filesystem is the source of truth for *progress* (`num_completed_batches`, `actual_num_records`). Splitting the two sources is what lets resume survive a crash between writing a row-group parquet and updating metadata - the filesystem reflects the durable state even when metadata lags behind. Reading actual row counts also matters for early-shutdown salvage, where a completed parquet file can contain fewer rows than the requested row-group size. Resume tolerates non-contiguous IDs because row groups can complete out of order.

Resume relies on stable row-group boundaries within a run. It treats datasets that have completed `process_after_generation()` as terminal: after-generation processors operate on the whole dataset and can re-chunk rows or change schema, invalidating row-group identity for later resume/extension. The terminal-state check raises a clear `DatasetGenerationError` (not a `TypeError`) when the persisted metadata is missing required fields such as `target_num_records`.

After-generation processors run unconditionally on the on-disk dataset whenever they are configured — including the case where resume sees every row group already on disk. This closes the crash window between the final row-group parquet write and the `post_generation_state="started"` marker write: in that window, the dataset is complete but post-generation never ran, and the on-disk parquet files are still clean (no processor has touched them). The `post_generation_state="started"` short-circuit still rejects the other direction (`process_after_generation()` crashed mid-rewrite, leaving the parquet files in an ambiguous state), so resume only re-runs after-generation when it is safe to do so.

Metadata writes are atomic (`tmp` file + `fsync` + `os.replace`) because `metadata.json` is the resume-configuration checkpoint. Corrupt or partially written metadata raises a clear `DatasetGenerationError` rather than falling through as a generic config mismatch.

`DatasetCreationResults` from a resume invocation reflects the full on-disk dataset for anything that reads the artifact directory (`load_dataset`, `count_records`, `load_analysis`, `export`, `push_to_hub`), but per-run observability (`task_traces`, model-usage logs, telemetry events) is scoped to the current invocation — the original run's in-memory state is not persisted across process boundaries.

When `RunConfig.write_scheduler_events` is enabled, each invocation also appends its scheduler event segment to `scheduler_events.jsonl` in the dataset directory.

## Data Flow

```
DatasetBuilder.build()
  → _build_async()
  → _prepare_async_run()
      → ExecutionGraph.create()
      → CompletionTracker.with_graph()
      → AsyncTaskScheduler(task admission, fair queue, salvage_rounds)
  → scheduler.run()
      → admit row groups under the configured row-group cap
      → fairly admit ready tasks from the frontier through task admission
      → tasks execute generators, update CompletionTracker
      → checkpoints via RowGroupBufferManager
  → collect TaskTraces, emit telemetry
```

Dataset-builder row-group admission is fixed: `RunConfig.max_concurrent_row_groups` (default `3`) is the hard in-flight cap. `buffer_size` controls the records per group, so raising the cap can increase active memory. The scheduler's adaptive row-group mode remains internal and is not wired through the public interface.

When request admission is available, async scheduling may use request-pressure snapshots as a read-only advisory during fair-queue selection. A request-pressured task can be skipped for an eligible peer without mutating request-admission state; provider/model/domain request limits remain owned by request admission.

## Design Decisions

- **One execution engine behind the API.** The async scheduler handles row-group parallelism, DAG-aware dispatch, resume, and checkpointing for all generation runs.
- **DAG-driven ordering** ensures columns with dependencies (e.g., a judge column that depends on a text column) are generated in the correct order, regardless of the order they appear in the config.
- **Fair async admission with bounded borrow by default** keeps the scheduler flowing across ready columns and model groups. `FairTaskQueue.select_next(...)` chooses eligible ready work, `TaskAdmissionController` leases scheduler resources before spawn, and `FairTaskQueue.commit(...)` removes the selected task only after admission succeeds. The default `BoundedBorrowTaskAdmissionPolicyConfig` computes a strict per-group share, lets a solo group borrow the remaining capacity, and makes borrowed groups yield when eligible peer pressure appears. Passing `bounded_borrow=None` selects strict-fair admission for tests and benchmark comparisons. Per-group virtual-time ordering prevents a large ready frontier from degenerating into a column-by-column wave, and scheduler-resource accounting remains separate from provider/model request admission.
- **Salvage rounds** retry failed tasks after all other tasks in a round complete, improving resilience against transient LLM failures without blocking the entire generation.
- **Unified DAG construction.** `topologically_sort_column_configs` (in `execution_graph.py`) determines column ordering using Kahn's algorithm; the runtime `ExecutionGraph` adds strategy-aware dependency tracking for the async scheduler.
