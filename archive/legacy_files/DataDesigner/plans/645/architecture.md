# Async Scheduling Architecture

This plan moves Data Designer's async engine from implicit scheduling behavior to explicit, layered admission control. The target architecture separates static generator resource metadata, dependency readiness, ready-work ordering, scheduler-level task admission, concrete model-request admission, capacity diagnostics, and runtime observability.

The guiding rule is: each layer owns one question and speaks through typed boundaries.

## Source Of Truth

The Markdown files in `plans/645` are the source of truth for this epic. The UML in [async-scheduling-epic.puml](async-scheduling-epic.puml) is the visual index and must be kept aligned with these files. GitHub issues should reference this plan and own implementation sequencing, validation commands, acceptance gates, and PR-level evidence.

## Target Shape

The durable data-preparation flow is:

```text
ColumnGenerator / plugin
  -> ColumnGenerator.get_scheduling_metadata()
  -> SchedulingMetadata
  -> TaskSchedulingResolver
  -> ResolvedTaskScheduling
  -> SchedulableTask inputs
```

The durable runtime control flow is:

```text
AsyncTaskScheduler
  -> CompletionTracker.ready_frontier()
  -> FairTaskQueue.enqueue(...)
  -> FairTaskQueue.select_next(scheduler-owned eligibility callback)
  -> TaskAdmissionController.try_acquire(selection.item, selection.queue_view)
  -> FairTaskQueue.commit(selection)
  -> execute admitted task/generator code

admitted task/generator code
  -> model facade/provider boundary
  -> ModelRequestExecutor.execute_attempt(...)
  -> RequestAdmissionController.acquire_async(RequestAdmissionItem)
  -> provider/model endpoint
  -> RequestAdmissionController.release(lease, outcome)
```

This is not a passive pipeline where `CompletionTracker`, `FairTaskQueue`, or `TaskAdmissionController` pushes work into the scheduler. `AsyncTaskScheduler` is the execution owner. It asks the readiness tracker for work, enqueues ready tasks, asks the queue to select a candidate through an admission eligibility callback, asks the task admission controller for a lease, commits the queue selection, executes the admitted task, and releases the lease.

`ModelRequestExecutor` is not a scheduler task wrapper. It is reached only when admitted task/generator code makes a concrete model call through the model facade/provider boundary. A task may make zero, one, or many concrete calls; each call attempt receives request admission independently.

## Layer Responsibilities

`SchedulingMetadata` is a generator-facing static resource declaration. It describes the resource shape a generator expects, such as local work or model-backed work. It does not expose queue internals, admitted limits, request domains, AIMD state, or runtime pressure.

`TaskSchedulingResolver` is the internal bridge from generator metadata to scheduler inputs. It produces `ResolvedTaskScheduling`, including `TaskGroupSpec` and `SchedulerResourceRequest`, and appends scheduler-owned flow identity such as output columns. It is the only scheduler grouping bridge once the legacy resolver is removed.

`CompletionTracker` owns dependency readiness. It reports the ready frontier and completion state to `AsyncTaskScheduler`. It does not enqueue into the ready queue, order ready work, admit resources, or inspect provider/model pressure.

`FairTaskQueue` owns ready-work membership and ordering. Its selection operation is non-mutating and takes an eligibility callback supplied by scheduler admission. It does not own dependency readiness, admitted counts, provider metadata, request admission, or policy state.

`TaskAdmissionController` owns scheduler-level task leases and resource accounting. `TaskAdmissionPolicy` decides whether a queued task is eligible under the current queue and admission views. The controller consumes resolved scheduler inputs and its engine-internal `TaskAdmissionConfig`; it must not inspect generators, user config layout, model registries, or provider registries directly.

`AsyncTaskScheduler` owns runtime control flow. It wires readiness, queue selection, task admission, worker spawn, task execution, salvage/retry behavior, shutdown, and lease release.

`ModelRequestExecutor` is the durable model-call boundary. It maps each concrete provider/model/domain call attempt to a `RequestAdmissionItem`, acquires a request lease, calls the provider, records request timing, and releases that exact lease with a classified outcome on success, rate limit, failure, cancellation, timeout, or unexpected exception.

`RequestAdmissionController` owns request-level provider/model/domain admission. `AdaptiveRequestAdmissionController` is the V1 AIMD-backed implementation. Internal `RequestFairQueue`, `RequestAdmissionPolicy`, and `AdaptiveRequestLimitState` are implementation components of this controller, not a second public layer.

`SchedulerAdmissionEventSink` and `RequestAdmissionEventSink` observe their own layers separately. `RuntimeCorrelationProvider` supplies shared runtime context, and `CorrelatedRuntimeView` joins timelines without collapsing the two telemetry systems.

## Audience And API Boundaries

The plan uses several contract categories. Keeping them separate prevents internal scheduling mechanics from becoming accidental plugin API.

Durable engine vocabulary is maintainer-facing unless this plan explicitly marks it plugin-facing or operator-facing. See [Module ownership](module-ownership.md) for final module homes, import rules, and test/benchmark ownership.

| Audience | Durable surface | Must not expose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Plugin authors | `ColumnGenerator.get_scheduling_metadata()` and `SchedulingMetadata` | queue state, task leases, request domains, AIMD state, runtime pressure |
| Users/operators | documented run config fields, `AsyncCapacityPlan`, benchmark and telemetry artifacts | internal queue/policy classes, per-lease mutation APIs |
| Engine implementers | scheduler/request admission protocols, DTOs, policies, snapshots, events | config-layer imports from engine runtime |
| Diagnostics and benchmarks | event DTOs, snapshots, correlation view, capacity plan | prompts, completions, row data, secrets, unbounded IDs as metric labels |

Package ownership follows Data Designer's structural layering:

| Package | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `data-designer-config` | public configuration DTOs and generator-facing metadata, including `SchedulingMetadata`, metadata validation errors, and future stable config surfaces only after an issue explicitly promotes them to public API |
| `data-designer-engine` | scheduler runtime DTOs, task/request admission controllers, queues, policies, leases, snapshots, events, capacity plan construction, and benchmark harness internals |
| `data-designer` | public interface wiring, CLI/operator presentation, and integration docs; it may consume engine/config contracts but must not make engine internals plugin API |

When a contract is shared across packages, the lower package owns the data definition and the higher package owns presentation or orchestration. Engine code may import config contracts; config code must not import engine runtime protocols.

Target repository ownership is part of the architecture, not an implementation detail. The epic does not include compatibility aliases, shim modules, transitional reexports, or duplicate old/new paths for scheduler or request-admission names.

## Module Ownership

The final target module layout is defined in [Module ownership](module-ownership.md). In summary:

- generator-facing metadata lives in `data_designer.config.scheduling`
- scheduler task models, readiness, queues, task admission, and task policies live under `data_designer.engine.dataset_builders.scheduling`
- `AsyncTaskScheduler` remains in `data_designer.engine.dataset_builders.async_scheduler` as the runtime coordinator only
- shared provider/model identity lives in `data_designer.engine.models.resources`
- concrete request admission lives under `data_designer.engine.models.request_admission`
- `ModelRequestExecutor` stays under `data_designer.engine.models.clients` because it wraps model clients at the acquire/call/release boundary
- capacity diagnostics live in `data_designer.engine.capacity`
- runtime admission events and correlation live in `data_designer.engine.observability`
- product/provider usage telemetry remains separate in `data_designer.engine.models.telemetry`

Implementation PRs should use these final homes directly and must not leave production compatibility names, compatibility modules, old-path reexports, or durable tests for replaced names.

## Two-Stage Admission

Task admission controls when ready dataset work may become a running worker. Request admission controls concrete provider/model/domain calls at the moment they are made.

The split is required because arbitrary custom Python can make zero, one, or many model calls dynamically. A task's metadata may help group and schedule the task, but it is not a promise of exact request count and must not reserve every future model call up front.

Task admission may consume request pressure snapshots as read-only policy input. The current branch includes a narrow request-pressure advisory selection path that can prefer an eligible, unpressured peer over a request-pressured candidate. It must not pre-acquire request permits, emulate AIMD, mutate request admission, or wrap provider/model/domain request admission. Broader provider/resource-aware scheduling remains #651 scope.

In V1, a task waiting inside request admission keeps its scheduler task lease until the task reaches a terminal outcome. This makes request wait visible without adding yield/reacquire complexity to the lease boundary. The cross-provider optimization target, where tasks blocked on one cooled-down provider do not occupy every scheduler slot while another provider has ready work, belongs to #651's provider/resource-aware task policy or an explicit later yield/reacquire design.

## Core Invariants

- Scheduler-level work is not spawned until `TaskAdmissionController` returns a `TaskAdmissionLease`.
- `FairTaskQueue.select_next(...)` does not remove work or mutate virtual-time state. `commit(selection)` is the only queue operation that removes the selected task.
- `select_next(...)`, `try_acquire(...)`, and `commit(selection)` are coordinated by `AsyncTaskScheduler` under a single dispatch critical section or an equivalent versioned-selection protocol.
- If `try_acquire(...)` succeeds but `commit(selection)` fails, the scheduler releases the task lease before retrying.
- Every task lease and request lease is released exactly once in all success, failure, retry, cancellation, shutdown, and salvage paths.
- Root/from-scratch work uses the same ready queue and task-admission path as downstream work.
- Request admission happens only at concrete model-call time through `ModelRequestExecutor`.
- Provider retries are visible to request admission: each outbound attempt either re-enters `ModelRequestExecutor` or is owned by a retry loop inside it that acquires/releases per attempt.
- Scheduler telemetry and request telemetry remain independently useful when the other subsystem is disabled.
- Capacity and benchmark artifacts must distinguish dependency readiness, ready ordering, scheduler admission wait, request admission wait, provider execution, cooldown/rate-limit behavior, and task completion.

## Non-Goals

- Do not collapse task admission and request admission into one subsystem.
- Do not expose scheduler internals as plugin API.
- Do not put provider retry, cooldown, or AIMD behavior into `AsyncTaskScheduler` or `TaskAdmissionController`.
- Do not put DAG readiness, row-group lifecycle, or task ordering into `RequestAdmissionController`.
- Do not configure OpenTelemetry SDKs or exporters in core runtime.
- Do not add public capacity knobs before benchmark evidence and docs justify them.
- Do not keep durable compatibility shims or aliases for replaced scheduler/request-admission names at epic completion.
