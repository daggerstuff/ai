# Plan: Engine-native record selection for exact accepted-row targets

## Summary

Add a declarative record-selection policy to a normal `DataDesigner.create()` run. Users define a boolean
column that identifies acceptable records, then request the number of accepted records they want:

```python
results = data_designer.create(builder, num_records=5_000)
```

When record selection is configured, `num_records` means **5,000 accepted output records**, not 5,000 candidate
attempts. The engine generates bounded candidate batches, evaluates the configured predicate column, checkpoints
only accepted rows, and continues until it has exactly the requested count or exhausts its candidate budget.

The core user contract is:

> Produce `X` records for which this declared boolean column is true.

The user declares the desired data and acceptance criterion. The engine owns candidate generation, rejection,
refill, trimming, progress accounting, artifact layout, and resume.

## Motivation

Many synthetic-data pipelines need an exact number of rows that satisfy a quality condition:

- Generate 5,000 answers whose judge score is at least 0.8.
- Generate 10,000 conversations that pass a safety or policy validator.
- Generate examples where two judges disagree.
- Generate images whose VLM evaluation marks all required attributes present.
- Generate tool-use traces that terminate successfully and contain a required tool call.

Today users can generate candidates and filter afterward, but that produces fewer than the requested number of
rows. They can also orchestrate multiple `create()` calls or workflow stages, but then the user owns retry loops,
artifact extension, trimming, and resume. That conflicts with DataDesigner's "declare, don't orchestrate"
contract.

PR #773 explored workflow-level repetition. Real-run testing exposed two important constraints:

1. Repeatedly extending the same static row-group plan couples progress to `buffer_size`; small increments can
   stop generating after the second extension.
2. Restarting an append loop at its first requested size can ask resume to shrink below already-persisted rows.

An engine-native design should therefore treat candidate batches as immutable first-class units and persist
candidate progress separately from accepted-output progress.

## Goals

1. Let users request exactly `X` accepted output rows in one `DataDesigner.create()` call.
2. Accept any declared boolean column as the selection predicate, including an expression derived from judge or
   validation output.
3. Require a hard candidate budget so generation is always bounded.
4. Preserve normal DAG generation, model usage accounting, processors, profiling, plugins, and lazy imports.
5. Support durable resume without regenerating committed candidate batches.
6. Stream accepted candidate batches to parquet without loading the full candidate or output dataset into memory.
7. Keep dependency direction intact: interface -> engine -> config.
8. Produce deterministic output ordering and deterministic trimming from candidate order.

## Non-goals for v1

- Returning or exporting every rejected candidate.
- Running several candidate batches concurrently.
- Cancelling downstream column tasks immediately when an early predicate becomes false.
- Supporting row-count-changing after-generation processors.
- Inferring an unbounded stopping condition from an expected acceptance rate.
- Replacing workflow chaining for genuinely separate generate/judge/enrich stages.

## User-facing API

### Recommended API

Add `RecordSelectionConfig` to `data_designer.config` and a builder convenience method:

```python
import data_designer.config as dd

answer_quality = dd.Score(
    name="answer_quality",
    description="Rate whether the answer is correct, complete, and well supported.",
    options={
        1: "Incorrect or unsupported",
        2: "Major problems",
        3: "Partially correct",
        4: "Correct and sufficiently supported",
        5: "Excellent",
    },
)

builder = dd.DataDesignerConfigBuilder(model_configs=[judge_model])
builder.add_column(
    dd.LLMJudgeColumnConfig(
        name="quality",
        model_alias="judge",
        prompt="Evaluate this answer: {{ answer }}",
        scores=[answer_quality],
    )
)
builder.add_column(
    dd.ExpressionColumnConfig(
        name="meets_criteria",
        expr="{{ quality.answer_quality.score >= 4 }}",
        dtype="bool",
        drop=True,
    )
)
builder.with_record_selection(
    dd.RecordSelectionConfig(
        predicate_column="meets_criteria",
        max_candidate_records=20_000,
        on_exhausted="raise",
    )
)

results = data_designer.create(builder, num_records=5_000)
```

The predicate can derive from any columns already represented in the execution graph:

```python
dd.ExpressionColumnConfig(
    name="meets_criteria",
    expr="{{ judge_score >= 0.8 and safety.valid and answer|length >= 100 }}",
    dtype="bool",
    drop=True,
)
```

The explicit boolean column is preferable to embedding a second expression directly in the selection policy:

- It participates in normal DAG dependency discovery.
- The predicate column itself can be previewed and debugged like any other column when record selection is disabled;
  V1 rejects selection-enabled preview runs.
- It can be generated by expressions, plugins, validators, or future generator types.
- `drop=True` already controls whether it appears in the final schema.
- Selection does not need its own template renderer or duplicate expression semantics.

A V1 predicate must be **row-local**: the value for one candidate may depend on that candidate's generated columns,
but not on the composition of the current batch or on candidates accepted in earlier batches. Custom and plugin
columns are supported under the same contract. Run-global deduplication, quotas, ranking, and global top-N selection
are out of scope because they would require durable cross-batch state and could revoke rows that were already
checkpointed.

A future convenience overload may create a hidden expression column, but it should compile to the same explicit
column model rather than introduce another runtime path.

### Config model

```python
class RecordSelectionExhaustion(StrEnum):
    RAISE = "raise"
    RETURN_PARTIAL = "return_partial"


class RecordSelectionConfig(ConfigBase):
    """Select records until the requested accepted-row count is reached."""

    predicate_column: str
    max_candidate_records: int = Field(gt=0, strict=True)
    on_exhausted: RecordSelectionExhaustion = RecordSelectionExhaustion.RAISE
```

Add an optional field to `DataDesignerConfig`:

```python
record_selection: RecordSelectionConfig | None = None
```

Add a builder method:

```python
def with_record_selection(
    self,
    config: RecordSelectionConfig,
) -> DataDesignerConfigBuilder:
    ...
```

`RecordSelectionConfig` belongs in the config package because it changes the meaning and identity of the output
dataset. It must be serialized and included in `DataDesignerConfig.fingerprint()`. Candidate concurrency and batch
sizing remain operational concerns owned by `RunConfig`.

`max_candidate_records` is a strict integer cost boundary. Boolean values (which are Python integer subclasses),
integral floats, and numeric strings are rejected instead of coerced. This keeps JSON/YAML configuration mistakes
from silently changing how much candidate generation the engine is authorized to perform.

### Public semantics

| Concern | v1 behavior |
|---|---|
| `num_records` | Desired number of accepted output records |
| Predicate | Existing column whose runtime values must be boolean or null |
| Predicate scope | Row-local; batch-global and run-global selectors are not supported |
| `True` | Accept the record |
| `False` | Reject the record |
| `None` / null | Reject and increment `null_predicate_records` |
| Non-boolean value | Fail with a canonical configuration/generation error |
| Bound | `max_candidate_records` is required |
| Exhausted + `raise` | Raise a canonical selection-exhausted error |
| Exhausted + `return_partial` | Complete with all accepted rows generated so far |
| Empty `return_partial` | Return a schema-bearing zero-row dataset and skip profiling |
| Overshoot | Keep the earliest accepted rows in candidate order, trimming to exactly `num_records` |
| Predicate output column | Included or removed according to its normal `drop` setting |
| Profiling | Profile only the final accepted dataset |
| Model usage | Include accepted and rejected candidate work |
| Preview | Reject record selection clearly in v1; use `create()` for accepted-row targets |
| Resume target | Require the same `num_records`; smaller and larger targets are incompatible in v1 |
| Hugging Face Hub | Publish only terminal accepted output and aggregate selection metadata |

At the `create()` boundary, validate:

- `max_candidate_records >= num_records`.
- A resumed selection run uses the same `num_records` target recorded by the original run.
- `predicate_column` exists.
- The predicate is not a seed-only side artifact with no materialized output.
- Known output types are boolean. Unknown plugin output types receive strict runtime validation.
- v1 has no row-count-changing after-generation processor.

## Alternatives considered

| Approach | Advantages | Problems | Decision |
|---|---|---|---|
| Generate the full candidate cap, then filter once | Smallest implementation | Always pays maximum cost; cannot stop early; large temporary output | Do not use as primary design |
| Repeat `DataDesigner.create(..., resume=ALWAYS)` with larger targets | Reuses current public API | Couples selection to resume row-group math; difficult callback resume; repeated profiling | Rejected |
| Engine-managed immutable candidate batches | Bounded, resumable, streams output, stops early | Requires new selection progress and candidate-batch manifest | **Recommended for v1** |
| Dynamically replace every rejected row inside one scheduler | Best theoretical efficiency | Invasive task-grid mutation, cancellation, refill, and ordering complexity | Future optimization |

### Is a v2 required?

No. V1 is the complete product feature, not a stepping stone that requires an immediate v2. It provides the full
user-visible contract: one declarative run produces exactly the requested number of matching rows, candidate work
is bounded, exhaustion is explicit, progress is resumable, and accepted rows and candidate attempts are accounted
for separately.

A possible v2 would preserve those semantics and improve performance only—for example, by running multiple candidate
batches concurrently, cancelling downstream work after early predicate rejection, or adapting batch size to the
observed acceptance rate. Work on v2 should begin only if production benchmarks show that v1's sequential candidate
batches materially limit throughput, provider utilization, latency, or cost. Until then, v1 is sufficient.

```

### Candidate and output coordinate spaces

Candidate position and accepted output position are different coordinates and must never be conflated:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    candidates["Candidate ordinals
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ..."]
    predicate["Predicate
F, T, F, T, T, F, ..."]
    accepted["Accepted output ordinals
0, 1, 2, ..."]

    candidates --> predicate --> accepted

    candidate_offset["Resume/seed offset uses
candidate ordinal"]
    output_count["Completion target uses
accepted count"]

    candidates --> candidate_offset
    accepted --> output_count
```

Seed readers advance using the candidate offset. `actual_num_records` and `DatasetCreationResults.count_records()`
report accepted output rows.

## Detailed engine design

### 1. `AcceptanceController`

Introduce an engine-owned controller with no interface dependency:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True, slots=True)
class CandidateBatch:
    candidate_batch_id: int
    row_group_id: int
    start_offset: int
    size: int


@dataclass(frozen=True, slots=True)
class SelectionDecision:
    accepted_indices: tuple[int, ...]
    rejected_count: int
    null_predicate_count: int
    failed_generation_count: int
    trimmed_accepted_count: int


class AcceptanceController:
    def has_reached_target(self) -> bool: ...
    def has_candidate_budget(self) -> bool: ...
    def next_candidate_batch(self) -> CandidateBatch: ...
    def select(self, dataframe: pd.DataFrame) -> SelectionDecision: ...
    def record_checkpoint(self, batch: CandidateBatch, decision: SelectionDecision) -> None: ...
```

Responsibilities:

- Track target accepted count.
- Track candidate attempts separately from accepted records.
- Allocate stable, monotonically increasing candidate batch IDs and offsets.
- Strictly evaluate the predicate column.
- Trim the last accepted candidate batch to the remaining output count.
- Expose progress for metadata and logs.
- Decide satisfied vs exhausted state.

The controller does not call column generators, write parquet, or own scheduler tasks.

### 2. Immutable candidate batch planning

`CandidateBatch` is the logical unit of record-selection work and progress. A row group is the scheduler's physical
task and buffering unit. They are distinct concepts even though v1 maps each candidate batch to exactly one fresh
row group. Keeping both identifiers explicit prevents selection progress from becoming coupled to row-group layout
and leaves room for later optimizations without changing the persisted selection model.

Do not extend a previously completed partial row group. Each candidate batch receives a new immutable row group:

```text
candidate batch 0 -> row group 0: candidate offset 0,    size 1000
candidate batch 1 -> row group 1: candidate offset 1000, size 1000
candidate batch 2 -> row group 2: candidate offset 2000, size 1000
...
```

Keep `CandidateBatch` as the single selection DTO and reuse the existing scheduler-facing `ExplicitRowGroupPlan`.
That plan already survives `normalize_row_group_plan()` and exposes offsets through
`row_group_start_offset()`, but its current offsets always begin at zero. Extend it with a backwards-compatible
`base_offset` so a one-row-group candidate plan preserves the candidate's absolute offset:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True, slots=True)
class ExplicitRowGroupPlan:
    row_groups: tuple[tuple[int, int], ...]
    base_offset: int = 0

    def __post_init__(self) -> None:
        next_offset = self.base_offset
        # Build the existing size and start-offset indexes.
        ...


candidate_plan = ExplicitRowGroupPlan(
    row_groups=((candidate_batch.row_group_id, candidate_batch.size),),
    base_offset=candidate_batch.start_offset,
)
```

`scheduled_total_rows` remains the sum of scheduled sizes, not `base_offset + size`. Because the normalizer preserves
an `ExplicitRowGroupPlan` instance, the scheduler's existing `current_row_group_start_offset` context receives the
absolute candidate offset. No parallel `CandidateBatchPlan` type is introduced. This avoids both seed replay and the
repeated-extension issue where a completed partial row group cannot grow while the next target remains inside the
same `buffer_size` boundary.

### 3. Candidate batch sizing

For v1, generate one candidate batch at a time. Its row group still gets normal per-column and per-cell parallelism.

Default candidate batch size:

```python
batch_size = min(
    run_config.buffer_size,
    target_accepted_records,
    remaining_candidate_budget,
)
```

This prevents a request for ten accepted rows from immediately generating the default 1,000 candidates. Users can
tune `RunConfig.buffer_size` when larger candidate batches produce better model throughput.

One candidate batch at a time provides:

- Predictable maximum overshoot of one candidate batch.
- No cancellation of already-running LLM requests.
- Straightforward candidate offsets and resume.
- Reuse of existing scheduler concurrency inside a row group.

Concurrent candidate batches can be introduced later after measuring throughput and overshoot.

V1 persists the run's `buffer_size` as selection resume-compatibility metadata and requires the same value when
resuming. A mismatch with `ResumeMode.ALWAYS` raises an incompatibility error; `ResumeMode.IF_POSSIBLE` logs a warning,
clears selection-owned artifacts, and starts fresh. `buffer_size` remains outside the data-config fingerprint because
it is operational state, but it is still part of the selection resume contract.

V1 also persists `target_num_records` as a runtime resume input and requires an exact match. It is not part of the
data-config fingerprint because it comes from `create(num_records=...)`, but it is compatibility-critical. A smaller
target can be below the already-persisted accepted count, while a larger target cannot recover predicate-true rows
trimmed from the previous final batch and would therefore violate the earliest-accepted-candidate ordering contract.
For either mismatch, `ResumeMode.ALWAYS` raises an incompatibility error and `ResumeMode.IF_POSSIBLE` visibly clears
all selection-owned and published artifacts before restarting from candidate offset zero.

### 4. Builder loop

Add a dedicated path inside `DatasetBuilder.build()` after config compilation and before profiling:

```python
def _build_with_record_selection(
    self,
    generators: list[ColumnGenerator],
    *,
    target_num_records: int,
    buffer_size: int,
    resume: ResumeMode,
) -> None:
    controller = self._load_or_create_acceptance_controller(...)

    while not controller.has_reached_target() and controller.has_candidate_budget():
        candidate_batch = controller.next_candidate_batch()
        self._run_candidate_batch(
            generators=generators,
            candidate_batch=candidate_batch,
            controller=controller,
        )

    self._handle_selection_completion(controller)
```

Initialize generator instances once and reuse them across candidate batches. In particular:

- Move `log_pre_generation()` out of `_prepare_async_run()` and call it once before entering the candidate loop.
  Ordinary build and preview paths must retain their existing once-per-logical-run behavior.
- Preserve stateful generator instances across candidate batches.
- Create new scheduler/tracker/buffer state for each immutable candidate batch.
- Accumulate model usage over the full logical run.
- Run after-generation processors and profiling once after selection completes.

### 5. Selection checkpoint hook

Selection belongs after all DAG columns for the candidate batch have completed and before post-batch processors and
final checkpointing:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    dag["Candidate batch DAG complete"] --> read["Read predicate column"]
    read --> validate{"All values bool or null?"}
    validate -->|no| error["Fail with canonical error"]
    validate -->|yes| mask["Build accepted mask"]
    mask --> trim["Trim accepted rows to remaining target"]
    trim --> post["Run row-count-preserving post-batch processors"]
    post --> write{"Any accepted rows?"}
    write -->|yes| parquet["Write accepted parquet batch"]
    write -->|no| no_parquet["No parquet batch"]
    parquet --> marker["Commit candidate-batch marker"]
    no_parquet --> marker
```

Add a scheduler callback before the existing `on_before_checkpoint` processor callback, for example:

```python
on_select_before_checkpoint: Callable[[int, int], SelectionDecision] | None
```

The callback should:

1. Read the completed candidate batch from `RowGroupBufferManager`.
2. Validate and apply the predicate.
3. Mark rejected and trimmed rows as dropped in the tracker and buffer.
4. Recompute dropped/surviving diagnostics.
5. Run post-batch processors only over accepted survivors.
6. Checkpoint accepted rows.
7. Commit the batch marker even when no rows survive.

The current checkpoint path computes `dropped_rows` before processor callbacks. Refactor it so selection occurs
before that count is finalized; otherwise diagnostics and all-rows-dropped behavior will be incorrect.

### 6. Predicate placement in the DAG

For v1, selection occurs when the whole candidate row is complete. The predicate column still has normal
dependencies, so a boolean expression derived from judge results is evaluated in the correct order.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    prompt["prompt"] --> answer["LLM answer"]
    answer --> judge["LLM judge"]
    judge --> score["judge_score"]
    score --> predicate["meets_criteria: bool"]
    predicate --> gate["Record selection gate"]
    gate -->|true| output["Accepted output"]
    gate -->|false| reject["Rejected candidate"]
```

A later optimization may treat the predicate as an early row gate. When it becomes false, the scheduler can call
its existing row-drop machinery and remove downstream tasks for that row. This can avoid expensive enrichment
after a cheap criterion fails. That optimization is not required for exact-count v1 semantics.

## Artifact and resume model

### Why existing output metadata is insufficient

For ordinary generation, planned row-group size and output row count are usually the same. Under record selection,
a candidate batch of 1,000 may checkpoint 137 accepted rows—or zero. Therefore these values are distinct:

- Candidate rows attempted.
- Accepted rows checkpointed.
- Output parquet batches written.
- Candidate batches durably completed.

Resume must not infer candidate progress solely from accepted parquet row counts.

### Proposed artifact layout

```text
artifacts/<dataset>/
  parquet-files/
    batch_00000.parquet            # published only when post_generation_state=complete
  processors-files/                # accepted-only, batch-addressed post-batch processor outputs
  selection-accepted/
    schema.parquet                  # zero-row output schema anchor; never a candidate partition
    batch_00000.parquet            # immutable accepted partition for candidate batch 0; optional
    batch_00001.parquet            # immutable accepted partition for candidate batch 1; optional
  selection-checkpoints/
    batch_00000.json               # always present after candidate batch 0 commits
    batch_00001.json               # present even when candidate batch 1 accepted zero rows
  selection-media-staging/         # transient, candidate-batch/row-scoped media
  selection-publication-staging/   # transient terminal materialization workspace
  partial-results/
    ...
  metadata.json
  builder_config.json
```

`parquet-files/` is the accepted-only published dataset. It contains only post-trim rows whose predicate evaluated
`True`; rows with false or null predicates, rows that failed before predicate evaluation, and predicate-true rows
trimmed from the final overshooting batch never appear there. The predicate column itself follows its normal `drop`
setting. During an interrupted run, `selection-accepted/` plus committed markers remain the source of truth and
`parquet-files/` must not be treated as publishable until terminal materialization completes.

Example batch marker:

```json
{
  "candidate_batch_id": 1,
  "row_group_id": 1,
  "candidate_start_offset": 1000,
  "candidate_records": 1000,
  "accepted_records": 137,
  "rejected_records": 861,
  "null_predicate_records": 2,
  "failed_generation_records": 0,
  "trimmed_accepted_records": 0,
  "accepted_partition": "selection-accepted/batch_00001.parquet"
}
```

`accepted_records` is the **post-trim persisted count** and must equal the row count of `accepted_partition`.
`trimmed_accepted_records` is diagnostic: it counts predicate-true rows discarded from the final overshooting batch
and is never added to accepted progress. Resume sums `accepted_records` to decide whether the target is satisfied.
`schema.parquet` is written from the first post-selection, post-batch DataFrame even if it has no rows. It preserves
the published output schema across process restarts when every candidate batch accepts zero rows; it is not included
in accepted counts and is not referenced by an individual batch marker.

For every marker, the following mutually exclusive accounting invariant must hold:

```text
candidate_records
  = accepted_records
  + rejected_records
  + null_predicate_records
  + failed_generation_records
  + trimmed_accepted_records
```

`rejected_records` counts explicit false predicates. `failed_generation_records` counts candidate slots dropped or
failed before predicate evaluation. For a zero-acceptance candidate batch, `accepted_partition` is null but the
marker still commits candidate progress.

### Global metadata

Extend `metadata.json` with a structured section:

```json
{
  "target_num_records": 5000,
  "actual_num_records": 5000,
  "post_generation_state": "pending",
  "post_generation_processed": false,
  "publication": {
    "managed_local_prefixes": ["parquet-files", "images", "processors-files/chat_format"],
    "managed_hub_prefixes": ["data", "images", "chat_format"]
  },
  "record_selection": {
    "predicate_column": "meets_criteria",
    "max_candidate_records": 20000,
    "on_exhausted": "raise",
    "run_buffer_size": 1000,
    "candidate_records_generated": 12000,
    "candidate_batches_completed": 12,
    "accepted_records": 5000,
    "rejected_records": 6986,
    "null_predicate_records": 14,
    "failed_generation_records": 0,
    "trimmed_accepted_records": 0,
    "acceptance_rate": 0.4166667,
    "selection_satisfied": true,
    "selection_exhausted": false,
    "next_candidate_batch_id": 12,
    "next_candidate_offset": 12000
  }
}
```

The candidate-batch marker directory and immutable `selection-accepted/` partitions are the selection source of
truth. `parquet-files/` is the published dataset: terminal materialization and after-generation processors may
delete and re-chunk it without invalidating selection checkpoints. Global metadata is a convenient summary and may
lag by one checkpoint during a crash.

After selection reaches a terminal state, materialize `parquet-files/` from the immutable accepted partitions, then
run allowed after-generation processors only against the published dataset. Terminal metadata points results readers
to `parquet-files/`; selection markers continue to reference `selection-accepted/`. This separation lets resume
validate selection progress even after `ProcessorRunner.run_after_generation()` rewrites published files.
V1 retains immutable accepted partitions for the artifact's lifetime, accepting up to one additional copy of the
accepted dataset as the cost of durable resume and deterministic publication.

### Publication completion state

Reuse and extend the existing top-level `post_generation_state` metadata instead of treating
`selection_satisfied` or `selection_exhausted` as proof that the artifact is publishable:

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `pending` | Selection is terminal, but the accepted published view has not been fully materialized and validated |
| `started` | Terminal materialization or after-generation processing is rebuilding mutable published artifacts |
| `complete` | Published parquet, allowed processor outputs, counts, and cleanup are complete and safe to expose |

Selection runs write `pending` after reconstructing a terminal marker set, including when a crash occurred after the
final batch marker but before the metadata update. They write `started` before replacing `parquet-files/` or running
after-generation processors, and atomically write `complete` only after the final row-count check and transient-artifact
cleanup succeed. `post_generation_processed` remains for compatibility and is true exactly when the state is
`complete`; even a selection run with no after-generation processors must reach `complete` after materialization.

Unlike the ordinary in-place after-generation path, a selection run can recover safely from `started`: immutable
`selection-accepted/` partitions remain the source of truth. Resume deletes incomplete mutable publication artifacts,
returns the state to `pending`, and rebuilds them without regenerating candidates.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> pending: terminal selection markers reconstructed
    pending --> started: begin terminal materialization
    started --> complete: output validated and cleanup committed
    started --> pending: crash recovery discards mutable output
    complete --> [*]
```

### Atomic commit and crash recovery

Treat the batch marker as the commit point:

1. Generate into the normal row-group buffer for the candidate batch.
2. Apply selection and processors.
3. Promote accepted engine-managed media from candidate staging into deterministic committed paths.
4. Write the post-trim rows to a deterministic immutable accepted-partition path when non-empty.
5. Write accepted-only dropped-column and post-batch processor artifacts under the same candidate batch ID.
6. Atomically write the batch marker.
7. Update global metadata.

On resume:

- Reconstruct accepted and candidate progress from committed batch markers.
- Verify every marker that names an accepted partition points to a readable file whose row count equals
  `accepted_records`.
- Delete uncommitted accepted partitions and committed-media prefixes for the next candidate batch before rerunning
  that batch.
- Delete uncommitted dropped-column and post-batch processor files for that candidate batch before rerunning it;
  committed batch-addressed processor artifacts remain valid alongside their marker.
- Sweep candidate staging for every committed batch as well as the next uncommitted batch. Accepted media is already
  promoted before marker commit, so leftover staging is always disposable, including after a crash between marker
  commit and normal staging cleanup.
- Clear ordinary in-flight partial results.
- Set the next seed/candidate offset from committed candidate counts, not accepted row counts.
- Require the persisted `target_num_records` to equal the requested target before reusing any checkpoint.
- Rebuild missing or incomplete published output from immutable accepted partitions without regenerating candidates.
- When `post_generation_state` is `pending`, `started`, or missing for a terminal marker set, remove incomplete
  `selection-publication-staging/` and `parquet-files/` before rebuilding. Never delete immutable accepted partitions,
  committed accepted media, or marker-committed post-batch processor artifacts during publication recovery.

### Resume state machine

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> LoadConfig
    LoadConfig --> AllocateFreshArtifact: resume=NEVER
    AllocateFreshArtifact --> Fresh: choose empty requested path or new timestamped sibling
    LoadConfig --> Fresh: no checkpoints
    LoadConfig --> Reconstruct: checkpoints exist and config, buffer, target match
    LoadConfig --> Incompatible: config, buffer, or target mismatch with resume=ALWAYS
    LoadConfig --> ResetForFresh: config, buffer, or target mismatch with resume=IF_POSSIBLE
    ResetForFresh --> Fresh: warn and clear selection-owned artifacts

    Reconstruct --> ValidateMarkers
    ValidateMarkers --> Corrupt: missing or invalid committed artifact
    ValidateMarkers --> Satisfied: accepted >= target
    ValidateMarkers --> Exhausted: candidates >= cap and accepted < target
    ValidateMarkers --> GenerateNext: accepted < target and budget remains

    Fresh --> GenerateNext
    GenerateNext --> CommitBatch
    CommitBatch --> Satisfied: accepted >= target
    CommitBatch --> Exhausted: candidate cap reached
    CommitBatch --> GenerateNext: more candidates needed

    Satisfied --> PublicationPending
    Exhausted --> PublicationPending: return_partial
    Exhausted --> [*]: raise
    PublicationPending --> [*]: continue with publication state machine
    Incompatible --> [*]
    Corrupt --> [*]
```

Selection resume inputs include the data-config fingerprint, persisted `run_buffer_size`, and persisted
`target_num_records`. The target must remain unchanged in v1; both smaller and larger values are incompatible.
`ResumeMode.NEVER` follows the existing `ArtifactStorage` contract: it never overwrites a non-empty requested dataset
directory. It resolves a new timestamped sibling and scopes all checkpoint discovery to that new artifact directory;
an empty requested directory contains no stale markers to reconstruct. Therefore a fresh `NEVER` run cannot combine
its markers with markers from an earlier run.

`IF_POSSIBLE` fallback must be visible in logs and must clear checkpoints, immutable accepted partitions, published
output, processor outputs, and staged or committed candidate media before fresh generation starts; it must never
silently combine incompatible runs.

## Processor interactions

### Pre-batch processors

Run normally on candidate rows before generation. Rows they drop consume candidate slots because work was admitted
for those candidate positions.

### Post-batch processors

Apply record selection first, then run post-batch processors over accepted rows. Existing post-batch processing is
row-count preserving under `strict_row_count=True`, so accepted counts remain valid and processor side artifacts
align with the output.

### After-generation processors

Row-count-changing after-generation processors can violate the exact-count guarantee after selection has finished.
For v1:

1. Reject known row-count-changing after-generation processors at compile/runtime setup.
2. Materialize the published dataset from immutable accepted partitions.
3. Run allowed after-generation processors once over the published dataset, never over
   `selection-accepted/`.
4. Verify the final output count still equals the selected count; raise a canonical error if a plugin violates the
   declared contract.

A future processor capability such as `preserves_row_count: bool` can make this validation explicit and reusable.

### Dropped predicate column

Evaluate selection before normal dropped-column handling. If the predicate has `drop=True`, preserve or omit it
using the existing `preserve_dropped_columns` behavior, aligned only to accepted rows.

## Media and side-effect artifacts

Rejected rows may already have written image, audio, video, trace, or plugin side artifacts. Filtering the parquet
row alone can leave orphan files, so V1 commits to candidate-scoped staging for engine-managed media:

1. Write candidate media below `selection-media-staging/batch_<id>/row_<candidate_ordinal>/` while generating.
2. After selection, promote only files referenced by accepted rows into a deterministic committed-media prefix and
   rewrite those row values before writing the immutable accepted partition.
3. Delete the entire candidate staging directory after the batch marker commits.
4. On crash recovery, sweep staging for committed batches and delete staging plus any committed-media prefix for an
   uncommitted batch before rerunning it.

Rejected media therefore cannot accumulate across committed batches. Text side-effect columns stored in the row are
filtered with the DataFrame. Plugins that write untracked external side effects outside the engine's media-storage
contract are not supported with record selection in V1; plugins must return tracked artifacts or remain side-effect
free.

## Hugging Face Hub publication

`DatasetCreationResults.push_to_hub()` keeps its current public API and publishes the accepted-only terminal view:

- Upload `parquet-files/` to the Hub `data/` config.
- Upload accepted engine-managed media and processor outputs through their existing published directories.
- Upload `builder_config.json` and sanitized `metadata.json`, including aggregate record-selection diagnostics.
- Never upload `selection-accepted/`, `selection-checkpoints/`, `selection-media-staging/`, partial results, rejected
  media, or per-batch marker paths.

Both result-based and folder-based upload require two independent conditions: a terminal selection state (either
`selection_satisfied=true`, or `selection_exhausted=true` with `on_exhausted=return_partial`) and
`post_generation_state=complete`. Selection completion alone is insufficient because the final marker may commit
before published materialization and after-generation processing finish. A stale or incomplete `parquet-files/`
directory is not sufficient. `on_exhausted=raise` does not return a `DatasetCreationResults`, and an artifact in
`pending` or `started` must be resumed or finalized before folder-based upload.

Hub metadata and the generated dataset card must use `metadata.json.actual_num_records` as the authoritative output
count, with `target_num_records` shown separately. This is required for partial output and especially for a valid
zero-row partial, where profiling is skipped and `column_statistics=[]`; falling back from missing statistics to the
target would incorrectly advertise the dataset as complete. The card should also show whether selection was
satisfied or exhausted, candidate attempts, and acceptance rate when record-selection metadata is present.

Accepted images must be promoted into the existing published `images/` directory because the current Hub client
uploads that directory explicitly. If V1 supports file-backed audio or video output, their published directories
must be added explicitly to the Hub uploader; a generic committed-media directory must not be silently omitted.

When rebuilding terminal output locally, replace mutable `parquet-files/` from a clean publication staging area.
Post-batch processor outputs are accepted-only, batch-addressed artifacts committed with each candidate marker, so
publication recovery retains them and uncommitted-batch cleanup removes only the next incomplete batch. A plugin
that creates additional untracked side effects during `process_after_generation` is outside the V1 recovery contract;
after-generation processors may transform the published DataFrame but must not depend on untracked terminal files.

When updating an existing Hub repository after resume or re-publication, submit deletion and upload operations for
every managed `data/`, media, and configured processor-output prefix. Delete a managed remote prefix even when the
current local artifact has no corresponding files, so obsolete shards and processor outputs cannot survive a changed
published layout. The Hub update should apply these deletes and uploads in one commit where the API supports it.

Persist a publication manifest in `metadata.json` that lists the managed local and Hub prefixes for the completed
artifact. Local publication recovery replaces the mutable published parquet prefix, while an incompatible
`IF_POSSIBLE` restart clears all engine-managed selection, processor, media, and published prefixes before starting
from candidate offset zero. Hub re-publication reads the previous remote metadata manifest and deletes stale files
from the union of previous and current managed prefixes before uploading the current allowlist in one commit; a
compatibility path may list known managed prefixes when publishing over an older repository with no manifest. This
scoped manifest prevents stale processor outputs without deleting unrelated user-managed files in the Hub repository.

## Failure and exhaustion behavior

### Exhaustion

When candidate budget is exhausted before the accepted target:

```python
if config.on_exhausted == RecordSelectionExhaustion.RAISE:
    # Engine-owned error; the interface catches and normalizes it.
    raise RecordSelectionExhaustedError(
        target_records=target,
        accepted_records=accepted,
        candidate_records=candidates,
    )
```

For `return_partial`, finalize the accepted output and record `selection_satisfied=false` and
`selection_exhausted=true`.

Define `RecordSelectionExhaustedError` in `data_designer.engine.dataset_builders.errors` as a
`DatasetGenerationError` carrying target, accepted, generated, and cap fields. `DataDesigner.create()` catches it
before the generic engine wrapper and raises a public `DataDesignerRecordSelectionExhaustedError`, preserving those
fields and the engine error as its cause. The engine never imports the interface package.

#### Zero-row partial output

If `return_partial` reaches the candidate cap with zero accepted rows and no authoritative early-shutdown or fatal
generation error, zero rows are a successful selection result:

- Materialize a deterministic schema-bearing empty parquet file in `parquet-files/` from the compiled output schema.
- Use the durable `selection-accepted/schema.parquet` anchor when terminal publication happens in a later process.
- Bypass the interface's ordinary zero-row generation-failure guard only when terminal selection metadata records
  `selection_exhausted=true` and `on_exhausted=return_partial`.
- Skip dataset profiling, persist `column_statistics=[]`, and return `analysis=None`. Formalize the existing runtime
  possibility by typing `DatasetCreationResults.load_analysis()` as `DatasetProfilerResults | None`.
- Keep typed early-shutdown and fatal generation errors authoritative; `return_partial` must not hide them.

### Early shutdown and generation failures

- Failed/dropped candidate slots count against `max_candidate_records`; they consumed an attempt and potentially
  model cost.
- Retryable model errors continue through the scheduler's normal retry/salvage path.
- If engine early shutdown fires, retain durably checkpointed accepted candidate batches.
- Existing typed early-shutdown errors remain authoritative unless the API explicitly chooses to map early
  shutdown to partial selection output.
- Do not parse error strings to decide selection behavior.

### Invalid predicate values

Runtime predicate validation should report:

- Predicate column name.
- Candidate batch ID.
- Invalid value and type, with bounded sample output.
- Expected boolean/null contract.

Avoid `bool(value)` coercion because non-empty strings such as `"false"` are truthy in Python. Expression columns
with `dtype="bool"` already provide the expected ergonomic conversion.

## Observability

Log and persist selection progress after every committed candidate batch:

```text
Record selection: accepted 4,217 / 5,000
Candidates generated: 12,000 / 20,000
Acceptance rate: 35.1%
```

Recommended counters:

- `record_selection_candidate_records`
- `record_selection_accepted_records`
- `record_selection_rejected_records`
- `record_selection_null_predicate_records`
- `record_selection_failed_generation_records`
- `record_selection_trimmed_records`
- `record_selection_candidate_batches_completed`
- `record_selection_acceptance_rate`
- `record_selection_satisfied`
- `record_selection_exhausted`

Progress should distinguish accepted output completion from candidate work. Model usage remains the source of truth
for inference cost across accepted and rejected candidates. `record_selection_acceptance_rate` is
`accepted_records / candidate_records_generated`, so failed attempts remain visible in end-to-end yield.

`DatasetCreationResults.count_records()` continues to return output records. A future structured
`load_selection_summary()` helper may expose the metadata section, but v1 can rely on `metadata.json`.

## Preview behavior

V1 rejects `preview()` when record selection is configured, before generation starts. The error must explain that
preview has no accepted-row retry/checkpoint contract and direct the user to `create()` or to preview the same config
with record selection disabled. This prevents the default preview size from being silently reinterpreted as an
accepted target and expanding work up to `max_candidate_records`. In-memory selection preview can be a separate,
explicitly designed follow-up.

## Implementation phases

### Phase 1: Config and validation

**Package:** `data-designer-config`

Likely files:

- `config/record_selection.py` — new models and enums.
- `config/data_designer_config.py` — add `record_selection`.
- `config/config_builder.py` — add `with_record_selection()`.
- `config/__init__.py` — lazy public exports.
- `config/fingerprint.py` — confirm selection is identity-relevant.

Deliverables:

- Serializable public model.
- Builder API.
- Unit validation for strict integer bounds and enum coercion.
- Fingerprint changes when any selection field changes.

### Phase 2: Interface contract and run-boundary validation

**Package:** `data-designer`

Likely files:

- `interface/data_designer.py` — interpret `num_records` as the accepted target, validate runtime bounds, reject
  selection preview, normalize exhaustion errors, and allow valid empty partial output.
- `interface/errors.py` — add the public selection-exhausted error.
- `interface/results.py` — formalize optional analysis for schema-bearing empty partial output.

Deliverables:

- `create()` routes the accepted-row target into the engine without changing ordinary-run semantics.
- Run-boundary validation covers `max_candidate_records >= num_records`, predicate existence/type, processor
  compatibility, and resume inputs.
- Engine exhaustion errors are normalized at the interface boundary.
- V1 preview rejection and zero-row `return_partial` behavior are explicit and tested.

### Phase 3: Engine controller and one-candidate-batch execution

**Package:** `data-designer-engine`

Likely files:

- `engine/dataset_builders/acceptance.py` — `AcceptanceController` and DTOs.
- `engine/dataset_builders/row_group_plan.py` — add `base_offset` to the existing `ExplicitRowGroupPlan`.
- `engine/dataset_builders/dataset_builder.py` — bounded candidate-batch loop.
- `engine/dataset_builders/async_scheduler.py` — selection callback before post-batch checkpoint.
- `engine/dataset_builders/utils/row_group_buffer.py` — selected checkpoint support.

Deliverables:

- Exact accepted output for a fresh run.
- Required candidate cap.
- `raise` and `return_partial` exhaustion.
- Deterministic trimming and ordering.
- One candidate batch in flight at a time.
- `log_pre_generation()` runs once per logical build across all candidate batches.
- Ordered seeds receive the absolute candidate offset through the existing scheduler context.

### Phase 4: Durable selection checkpoints, media, publication, and resume

Likely files:

- `engine/storage/artifact_storage.py` — selection checkpoint paths and atomic marker I/O.
- `engine/dataset_builders/dataset_builder.py` — resume reconstruction.
- `engine/dataset_builders/acceptance.py` — controller hydration from markers.
- Engine media-storage integration — candidate/row-scoped staging, accepted promotion, and crash cleanup.

Deliverables:

- Candidate progress reconstructed independently from accepted parquet row count.
- Zero-acceptance candidate batches remain durably complete.
- A durable zero-row schema anchor makes all-false partial output reconstructible after restart.
- Immutable accepted partitions remain valid when published output is re-chunked by after-generation processors.
- Marker counters satisfy the complete candidate-accounting invariant.
- Crash-window cleanup for uncommitted candidate-batch artifacts.
- Cleanup of staging left after committed markers and deterministic rebuild of incomplete published/processor output.
- Compatible `ResumeMode.ALWAYS` and `ResumeMode.IF_POSSIBLE` behavior for config, `buffer_size`, and target changes.
- Explicit `post_generation_state` transitions from terminal selection through publication completion.

### Phase 5: Results, Hub publication, docs, and examples

**Packages:** interface, Hugging Face integration, and Fern docs

Likely files:

- `interface/results.py` — preserve the existing `push_to_hub()` surface.
- `integrations/huggingface/client.py` — enforce terminal selection state, upload only published artifacts, and
  replace managed remote prefixes.
- `integrations/huggingface/dataset_card.py` — use authoritative actual counts and selection diagnostics.

Deliverables:

- User-facing example with judge score -> boolean expression -> exact target.
- Metadata documentation.
- Exhaustion and resume examples.
- Explicit after-generation processor and media-artifact limitations.
- Accepted-only Hub publication for satisfied, partial, and schema-bearing empty outputs.
- No upload of selection checkpoints, immutable internal partitions, staging, or rejected media.
- Folder-based upload requires `post_generation_state=complete` in addition to terminal selection metadata.
- Re-publication replaces or deletes stale remote data, media, and configured processor-output prefixes.

### Optional post-v1 optimization (not required for feature completeness)

Compile the predicate as a scheduler row gate. Once its value is false:

- Drop the row through `CompletionTracker.drop_row()`.
- Remove downstream tasks from the ready frontier.
- Cancel no task that is already in flight in v1 of the optimization.
- Preserve the same candidate/accepted checkpoint contract.

This optimization changes cost, not output semantics. It is not part of the v1 definition of done and creates no
commitment to implement a v2; benchmark evidence should justify it first.

## Test plan

### Config tests

- Predicate column is required and must exist.
- `max_candidate_records` must be positive.
- Run boundary rejects `max_candidate_records < num_records`.
- Selection participates in config serialization and fingerprinting.
- String exhaustion values normalize to enums.

### Interface tests

- `create(num_records=X)` routes `X` as the accepted target only when selection is configured.
- `max_candidate_records < num_records` fails before generation.
- Engine exhaustion maps to `DataDesignerRecordSelectionExhaustedError` with structured counts.
- `preview()` with record selection fails before generation with actionable guidance.
- Zero-row `return_partial` bypasses only the expected selection-exhaustion guard and returns `analysis=None`.

### Fresh-run integration tests

- Target reached in the first candidate batch.
- Target reached after three or more candidate batches with default `buffer_size`.
- Final candidate batch overshoots and trims to exact target.
- Predicate column is removed when `drop=True`.
- Predicate column remains when `drop=False`.
- Null predicate values reject and increment metadata.
- Non-boolean predicate values raise.
- `return_partial` returns non-empty partial output.
- `return_partial` returns a schema-bearing empty dataset when no candidates pass, skips profiling, and reports zero
  records through `DatasetCreationResults`.
- `raise` reports target, accepted, generated, and cap.
- Post-batch processor output aligns with accepted rows.
- Profiling counts accepted rows only.
- Usage accounting includes rejected candidate calls.
- Marker categories, including failed and trimmed rows, sum exactly to candidate attempts.
- `log_pre_generation()` is called once when selection requires three or more candidate batches.

### Seed and ordering tests

- Candidate batch offsets are contiguous and do not repeat seed rows unexpectedly.
- `ExplicitRowGroupPlan(base_offset=...)` survives normalization and candidate batch 1's ordered seed starts strictly
  after candidate batch 0 rather than replaying offset zero.
- Ordered seed sampling preserves candidate order.
- Shuffle sampling remains deterministic under the existing seed contract.
- Trimming retains earliest accepted candidate ordinals.
- Stateful generators preserve state across candidate batches.

### Resume tests

- Interrupt during candidate batch 0 before checkpoint; candidate batch 0 reruns.
- Interrupt after candidate batch 2 commits; resume starts at candidate batch 3's candidate offset.
- Candidate batch accepting zero rows is not regenerated after resume.
- Global metadata lag is reconstructed from batch markers.
- Orphan uncommitted accepted partitions are removed and regenerated.
- Missing accepted partition referenced by a committed marker raises corruption error.
- Changed selection config with `ALWAYS` fails compatibility; with `IF_POSSIBLE` logs and restarts cleanly.
- Changed `buffer_size` follows the same `ALWAYS`/`IF_POSSIBLE` compatibility rules.
- Smaller and larger `target_num_records` values each fail with `ALWAYS`; with `IF_POSSIBLE`, each logs the mismatch,
  clears all prior selection/publication artifacts, and restarts from candidate offset zero.
- An unchanged target resumes normally and retains the earliest-accepted-candidate ordering guarantee.
- Completed exact output is reused without re-evaluating the predicate.
- Exhausted partial output is reused according to its recorded terminal state.
- After-generation re-chunking of `parquet-files/` does not invalidate immutable accepted partitions or markers.
- Missing/incomplete published output is rebuilt from immutable accepted partitions without candidate regeneration.
- A crash after the terminal batch marker but before publication metadata is written reconstructs
  `post_generation_state=pending` and finalizes without generating another candidate.
- A crash with `post_generation_state=started` and partial parquet or processor output removes mutable output and
  rebuilds it from immutable accepted partitions before marking `complete`.
- Candidate staging left by a crash after a committed marker is swept during resume.

### Failure and boundary tests

- Candidate cap exactly equals target.
- Candidate cap ends with a smaller final candidate batch.
- Early shutdown after some accepted candidate batches preserves durable output.
- All rows fail generation before predicate evaluation.
- Predicate generator itself fails.
- Row-count-changing after-generation processor is rejected or detected.
- Accepted media is promoted, rejected media is deleted, and an interrupted uncommitted media batch is cleaned on
  resume.
- Uncommitted batch-addressed processor outputs are removed before that candidate batch is re-executed, while
  marker-committed outputs survive publication recovery.

### Hugging Face Hub tests

- A satisfied run uploads only accepted published parquet rows to `data/`.
- A non-empty partial card reports `actual_num_records`, target, exhausted state, candidate attempts, and acceptance
  rate.
- A zero-row partial uploads its schema-bearing empty parquet and reports zero records rather than the target.
- Folder-based upload rejects terminal selection metadata when `post_generation_state` is missing, `pending`, or
  `started`, and accepts it only when the state is `complete`.
- Internal accepted partitions, markers, staging, and rejected media are never uploaded.
- Accepted images remain reachable under `images/`; supported file-backed audio/video directories are explicit.
- Re-publishing to an existing Hub repository removes obsolete managed data, media, and processor-output shards,
  including prefixes present only in the previous publication manifest and no longer present locally.

### Regression tests motivated by PR #773

- `num_records` smaller than default `buffer_size`, target first reached on candidate batch 3.
- Interrupted run after candidate batch 2 resumes without requesting a smaller target.
- Candidate progress never derives from accepted output row count.
- A later low-acceptance candidate batch cannot replace or erase earlier accepted output.

## Risks and mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Low acceptance causes runaway cost | Required hard candidate cap |
| Candidate/output counts are conflated | Mutually exclusive marker counters with a required sum invariant |
| Resume repeats seeds | Extend and reuse `ExplicitRowGroupPlan(base_offset=...)`; test ordered seeds across batches |
| Zero-acceptance candidate batch is invisible | Always write a candidate-batch completion marker |
| Last candidate batch overproduces | Deterministically trim before checkpoint |
| Processor changes selected count or rewrites marker files | Immutable accepted partitions; block/verify resize; process only published output |
| Rejected media leaks disk space | Candidate/row-scoped staging, accepted promotion, and deterministic crash cleanup |
| Throughput drops with sequential candidate batches | Preserve full within-row-group concurrency; add concurrent candidate batches only if benchmarks justify it |
| Plugin predicate returns surprising types or uses global state | Strict runtime boolean/null validation and a row-local V1 predicate contract |
| Metadata write lags parquet write | Marker-based filesystem reconstruction and orphan cleanup |
| Runtime settings change during resume | Persist `buffer_size`; fail `ALWAYS` or reset `IF_POSSIBLE` on mismatch |
| Accepted target changes during resume | Persist `target_num_records`; reject both smaller and larger targets for `ALWAYS`, visibly reset for `IF_POSSIBLE` |
| Published output is interrupted or re-chunked | Gate publication on `post_generation_state=complete`; rebuild mutable output from immutable accepted partitions |
| Immutable and published datasets increase disk use | Document up to one extra accepted-data copy and remove both through normal artifact cleanup |
| Hub publication leaks internal/rejected artifacts | Upload an explicit published-artifact allowlist; reject non-terminal selection state |
| Partial or empty Hub card reports the target as actual | Use `metadata.json.actual_num_records` as the authoritative card count |
| Re-publishing leaves stale local or remote shards | Replace/delete managed data, media, and processor prefixes locally and on the Hub |

## V1 decisions

- Use `RecordSelectionConfig` publicly and `AcceptanceController` internally.
- Require an explicit, row-local boolean predicate column; global ranking, quotas, and deduplication are out of scope.
- Require `max_candidate_records`.
- Treat null as rejected and non-boolean as an error.
- Use `num_records` as the accepted-row target; do not duplicate it in selection config.
- Run one immutable candidate batch at a time.
- Derive candidate batch size from `min(buffer_size, target, remaining_budget)`.
- Extend and reuse `ExplicitRowGroupPlan` with an explicit base offset; do not add `CandidateBatchPlan`.
- Require the same `buffer_size` for resume, with `ALWAYS` failure and visible `IF_POSSIBLE` reset semantics.
- Require the same `target_num_records` for resume; v1 does not shrink or extend an existing selection run.
- Commit a marker for every candidate batch, including zero-acceptance candidate batches.
- Make `accepted_records` the post-trim persisted count and account explicitly for failed-generation and trimmed rows.
- Keep immutable accepted partitions separate from mutable published output.
- Run selection before post-batch processors.
- Block row-count-changing after-generation processors for v1.
- Stage engine-managed media per candidate row and promote only accepted artifacts.
- Keep rejected records out of the final dataset and expose only aggregate diagnostics.
- Return a schema-bearing empty dataset with no profile for valid zero-row `return_partial` exhaustion.
- Reject record selection in `preview()` for v1.
- Normalize an engine selection-exhausted error into a public interface error.
- Keep `push_to_hub()` API-compatible while publishing only terminal accepted output and sanitized aggregate metadata.
- Reuse `post_generation_state` so selection completion and publication completion are distinct; only `complete` is
  publishable, and interrupted mutable output is rebuilt from immutable accepted partitions.
- Replace stale local published data during recovery, clear all engine-managed prefixes on incompatible
  `IF_POSSIBLE` restart, and delete stale managed Hub files during re-publication.
- Defer early predicate task cancellation and concurrent candidate batches.

## Definition of done

The feature is complete when a user can declare a boolean criterion and reliably obtain exactly `X` matching rows
from one `DataDesigner.create()` call, with:

- Bounded candidate generation.
- Exact deterministic trimming.
- Correct default-buffer behavior across three or more candidate batches.
- Durable resume after any committed candidate batch.
- Resume compatibility rejects both smaller and larger accepted targets unless `IF_POSSIBLE` visibly restarts fresh.
- Correct zero-acceptance checkpoint handling.
- Absolute candidate offsets preserved through `ExplicitRowGroupPlan` without ordered-seed replay.
- Marker counts that reconcile accepted, rejected, null, failed-generation, and trimmed candidate outcomes.
- Immutable accepted partitions that survive published-output processing and re-chunking.
- Accepted-only output, processing, and non-empty profiling; valid empty partial output skips profiling explicitly.
- Engine-managed rejected media cleanup with crash-safe candidate staging.
- Explicit publication completion metadata with recovery from crashes before or during materialization and processor
  output generation.
- Hugging Face publication that exposes only terminal accepted output, reports partial/empty counts correctly, and
  cannot leak selection-internal or stale processor artifacts.
- Clear V1 rejection of preview and run-global predicate semantics.
- Complete candidate/acceptance metadata, public exhaustion errors, and model usage accounting.
- No dependency-layer violations.
- Documentation that explains cost, bounds, partial exhaustion, and resume semantics.

Meeting this definition completes the feature. No v2 work is required unless measured performance warrants a
separate optimization effort.
